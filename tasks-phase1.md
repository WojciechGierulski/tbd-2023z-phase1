IMPORTANT ❗ ❗ ❗ Please remember to destroy all the resources after each work session. You can recreate infrastructure by creating new PR and merging it to master.

1. Authors:

   **Grupa nr 7**
   
   * Wojciech Gierulski
   * Karol Kociołek
   * Jakub Płudowski

   **[link to forked repo](https://github.com/WojciechGierulski/tbd-2023z-phase1)**
   
3. Fork https://github.com/bdg-tbd/tbd-2023z-phase1 and follow all steps in README.md.

4. Select your project and set budget alerts on 5%, 25%, 50%, 80% of 50$ (in cloud console -> billing -> budget & alerts -> create buget; unclick discounts and promotions&others while creating budget).

  ![img.png](doc/figures/budget.png)

4. From avaialble Github Actions select and run destroy on main branch.

![img.png](doc/figures/destroy-main.png)

5. Create new git branch and add two resources in ```/modules/data-pipeline/main.tf```:
    1. resource "google_storage_bucket" "tbd-data-bucket" -> the bucket to store data. Set the following properties:
        * project  // look for variable in variables.tf
        * name  // look for variable in variables.tf
        * location // look for variable in variables.tf
        * uniform_bucket_level_access = false #tfsec:ignore:google-storage-enable-ubla
        * force_destroy               = true
        * public_access_prevention    = "enforced"
        * if checkcov returns error, add other properties if needed
       
    2. resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "tbd-data-bucket-iam-editor" -> assign role storage.objectUser to data service account. Set the following properties:
        * bucket // refere to bucket name from tbd-data-bucket
        * role   // follow the instruction above
        * member = "serviceAccount:${var.data_service_account}"

    }
    ```

    Create PR from this branch to **YOUR** master and merge it to make new release. 
    
    ***place the screenshot from GA after succesfull application of release with this changes***

6. Analyze terraform code. Play with terraform plan, terraform graph to investigate different modules.

    ***describe one selected module and put the output of terraform graph for this module here***

    Module: **data-pipeline**

    Overall, this module establishes buckets, permissions for their usage, and manages data within these buckets.

    Description of components in mian.tf:

    1. **locals**
        Local variables for configuring resources.

    2. **job-code, dag-code**
        Definition of Python files containing job code (spark-job.py) and DAG code (dag-code.py).

    3. **tbd-code-bucket, tbd-data-bucket**
        Definition of GCP Buckets:
        
        * tdb-code-bucket: Bucket designated for storing code related to Spark jobs (spark-job.py).
        * tbd-data-bucket: Bucket designated for storing Apache Airflow data.

    4. **tbd-code-bucket-iam-viewer, tbd-data-bucket-iam-editor**
        The data service account is granted storage object user and viewer permissions on buckets defined within this module.

7. Reach YARN UI
   
   ***place the port and the screenshot of YARN UI here***

    **port: 8088**
   ![img.png](doc/figures/yarn.png)
   
8. Draw an architecture diagram (e.g. in draw.io) that includes:
    1. VPC topology with service assignment to subnets
    2. Description of the components of service accounts
    3. List of buckets for disposal
    4. Description of network communication (ports, why it is necessary to specify the host for the driver) of Apache Spark running from Vertex AI Workbech
  
    ***place your diagram here***

9. Add costs by entering the expected consumption into Infracost

   ***place the expected consumption you entered here***
